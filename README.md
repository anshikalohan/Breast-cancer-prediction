# Breast Cancer Prediction 

A comprehensive machine learning project for predicting breast cancer diagnosis using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. This project includes exploratory data analysis, model building, and an interactive Streamlit web application.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline for binary classification of breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant. The model uses 30 features computed from breast mass images to make predictions with high accuracy.

### Key Features:
- **Comprehensive EDA**: Detailed exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- **Logistic Regression Model**: High-performance classification model
- **Interactive Web App**: User-friendly Streamlit application
- **Model Interpretability**: Feature importance analysis
- **Real-time Predictions**: Instant cancer risk assessment 

## Dataset

The [Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) contains 569 samples with 30 features each, computed from digitized images of breast mass fine needle aspirates.


## Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: ~98%
- **Precision**: High precision for both classes
- **Recall**: Excellent recall for malignant cases
- **F1-Score**: Balanced performance


## Tech Stack

- **Data Science**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit
- **Model Persistence**: joblib
- **Development**: Jupyter Notebooks
